# Method Overloading: If we have two method in same name but different parameter's or arguments it's called "Method Overloading"

#Example: If we have "Student class" and "Student class" if we have two have let's say average one takes two parameters and one takes three paeameters
#This called "Method Overloading"
# def average (a,b)
#def average (a,b,c)

##** But in Python we can not take two methods in same name...


##Method Overriding: Suppose we have two methods with the same name and same number of parameters or arguments we can call it "Method Overriding"
## We can use it  with inheritence
